## Description

### What needs are we meeting?
* The  EMS Services have always battled to maintain coverage of their municipal areas, due to overwhelming calls they receive on a daily basis.

They often are in danger of bottoming out their available number of units due to high call volumes.


### What would be the foreseeable consequences if the needs are unmet?
* Therefore, we sometimes hear tragic stories of patients not receiving their care in due time because their original unit has been siphoned off to a higher priority call, due to dispatch triage algorithm which cannot naturally detect the precise condition of patients.



### What were your goals?
* Our project has been inspired by the recent developments in the EMS services to combat this limited coverage issue through Community Paramedicine programs.

* There have been increasing interest in special deployment program to serve the section of the city’s population who could be cared for in their own home.
This population is comprised of Retirement home residents, nursing home residents, and palliative patients.
* By tailoring the EMS responses to fit their need,
	1. we would prevent unnecessary transport, and reduce Emergency Department’s patient load, by allowing Medics to perform tasks that would’ve been done in hospital: such as suturing, casting, and any follow-up care they need after they were discharged from hospital.
	2. We would free up more EMS units to service the coverage.
	3. And we would reduce the patients’ discomfort. They often are triaged with a low priority, and wait for hours until they see a doctor.



### What have you done about it?
* We tried to meet those needs in our app.
